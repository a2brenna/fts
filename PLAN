Seperate Server/Client namespace:
    Prefix all internal server object keys with $PREFIX:SERVER: and all client
keys with $PREFIX:CLIENT.  Prevents clients from accidentally/deliberately
messing with objects used for internal server bookkeeping.

Metadata Caching:
    Create way to cache and save metadata on gracefull shutdown and then load it
back up. Store metadata in its own object and then append reference to
$PREFIX:SERVER:metadata key On load, append some sort of invalidation notice
to $PREFIX:SERVER:metadata so we know its not to be trusted until a fresh one
is written
